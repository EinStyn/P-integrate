<i>If there's a popular payment platform you have experience with that's not included, fork the repo, create a new branch, write your awesome code and hit that pull request button</i>.


## Usage
Simply clone this repository and follow the code guides. <b>Emphasis was put in making sure the code was well commented</b>. Also, this app is simply a guide and wasn't built for direct installation; however, if you want to test-run any of the activities, simply place a launcher-type intent filter inside the activity tag in the manifest.

## How to Contribute
 - Fork this repository.
 - Navigate to the branch representing the payment platform you want to contribute to. If you want to add your own payment platform, simply create a new branch.
 - Write your super awesome code with super detailed commenting.
 - Test your code and ascertain that it is working fine.
 - Get a cup of coffee (Ginger tea works fine too)
 - Create a pull request while sipping from the cup.
